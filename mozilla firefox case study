Abstract: This case study explores Mozilla, a prominent open-source organization known for its contributions to web technologies and internet advocacy. It examines Mozilla's developmental models, licensing strategies, mode of funding, and the diverse applications of its products in both commercial and non-commercial contexts. This study sheds light on Mozilla's impact on the web ecosystem and its commitment to openness and user privacy.Developmental Models: Mozilla employs a collaborative and community-driven developmental model. Projects like the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email client, and various web standards initiatives are developed by a global community of volunteers and paid contributors. Mozilla's open-source culture encourages transparency, open discussion, and decentralized decision-making.Licensing: Mozilla's software is typically released under open-source licenses such as the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and the GNU General Public License (GPL). These licenses grant users the freedom to view, modify, and distribute Mozilla's software. Mozilla also promotes open standards and actively participates in standardization processes for web technologies.Mode of Funding: Mozilla's primary source of funding historically came from search engine partnerships, where search engines pay Mozilla for default placement in the Firefox browser. However, Mozilla has diversified its funding sources by seeking donations from individual supporters and forming partnerships with organizations that share its mission. This approach helps Mozilla maintain its independence and advocacy for an open and user-centric web.Commercial/Non-Commercial Use: Mozilla's products, particularly the Firefox web browser, are used in both commercial and non-commercial settings. Many individuals and businesses rely on Firefox for web browsing due to its speed, privacy features, and extensive add-on ecosystem. Mozilla's focus on user privacy and open standards has made Firefox a preferred choice for users concerned about data protection. Additionally, Mozilla's web technologies and standards are widely adopted by web developers and organizations for both commercial and non-commercial web applications.
